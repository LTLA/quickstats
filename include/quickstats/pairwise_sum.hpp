 * Perform pairwise summation on an array of numeric elements.
 * The array is recursively halved until each subarray is no greater than `limit_`.

 * Compared to naive summation, this reduces round-off error from floating-point imprecision with minimal loss of performance. 
 *
 * @tparam limit_ Maximum number of elements in the subarray to be summed in sequence.
 * This should be positive and is typically a power of 2.
 * Larger values reduce the recursion overhead at the cost of weakening the mitigations from round-off error.
 * @tparam accumulators_ Number of accumulators to sum each subarray.
 * This should be positive and should be less than `limit_ / 2`.
 * It should also be a power of 2.
 * Larger values improve instruction parallelization at the cost of increased binary size and potential register spills.
 * @tparam Input_ Numeric type of the input data.
 * @tparam Modifier_ Function to apply to each element of the input data to modify it.
 * @tparam Output_ Numeric type of the sum.
 *
 * @param num_total Total number of observations.
 * @param[in] ptr Pointer to an array of length `num_total`, containing the elements to be summed.
 * @param mod Function that accepts an index into `ptr` (as a `std::size_t`) and the value of the element (as an `Input_`) and returns an `Output_`.
 * The return value will be used in the summation.
 * @param work Workspace that can be re-used across multiple `pairwise_sum()` calls.
 *
 * @return Sum of all (modified) elements in `[ptr, ptr + num_total)`.

/* COMMENTS:
 * I tried to write a multi-threaded version of this where each direct summation was submitted to a separate worker until all workers were occupied,
 * and then added the results once they became available from each worker. 
 * This worksharing is fine-grained but imposes a high cost for inter-thread communication relative to the summation for small `limit_`. 
 * As a consequence, the performance of this multi-threaded version is worse than its serial counterpart.
 *
 * I could have implemented alternative approaches that involve less communication but require more memory.
 * For example, we could split elements into the subarrays ahead of time, distribute the summations to threads once, and then sum the results once all workers are done.
 * This greatly reduces the cross-talk between threads but requires an extra allocation to store the results.
 *
 * TBH, the easiest and most performant approach to parallelization is to just split your input array into one subarray per worker,
 * perform the sum within each worker for that subarray, and then add the sums afterwards.
 * This won't give exactly the same result as serial execution but we've crossed that bridge already.
 * (If exact results are required, we can split it into ceil(log2(num_workers)) subarrays,
 * which allows us to follow the same halving as pairwise_sum() to get the exact same result at the cost of suboptimal worksharing.)
 *
 * In any case, summation is already so fast that I don't think we need to spend a lot of effort in thinking about parallelization.
 * Especially given that, in real applications, the other threads will typically be occupied elsewhere.
 * Indeed, we don't deal with parallelization in other parts of this library, so it would be odd to implement it here. 
 *
 * I also have a sneaking suspicion that the serial code is already pseudo-parallelized via out-of-order execution,
 * where the next summation starts before the first one has ended.
 * I say this because pairwise_sum() somehow manages to be slightly faster than std::accumulate() in our R bindings.
